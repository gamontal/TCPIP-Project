#TCP/IP Chat
##Disclaimer
This is a very quick and dirty implementation of an IP chat using Visual Basic and the .NET libraries. This is not the most elegant or efficient solution, but it works. If you want to continue developing this or something similar don't hesitate to fork this repo.

##Compilation
You can compile the server and client files using utilities like Visual Studio's [Developer Command Prompt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f35ctcxw.aspx), or make your own project and use the source code from there.
