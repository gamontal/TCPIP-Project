# TCP/IP Chat

## Disclaimer

This project has been heavily modified to the point of being more of a proof of concept rather than an actual IP chat. Also keep in mind that it was made as a homework for a computer security class. Visual Basic and the .NET libraries were used for connections. If you want to continue developing this or something similar don't hesitate to fork this repo.

## Compilation

You can compile the server and client files using utilities like Visual Studio's [Developer Command Prompt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f35ctcxw.aspx), or make your own project and use the source code from there.
